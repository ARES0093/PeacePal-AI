# üïäÔ∏è PeacePal-AI: Your AI Mental Wellness Companion

An AI-powered mental health support chatbot built with **Streamlit** and the lightning-fast **Groq LLaMA-3** model. PeacePal-AI offers a safe and accessible space to receive general mental wellness suggestions through both text and voice.

---

## 1. Project Overview üìù

PeacePal-AI is an interactive and empathetic chatbot designed to provide initial mental wellness support. In a world where mental health is paramount, not everyone has immediate access to resources. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a first point of contact‚Äîa digital companion that listens and provides thoughtful, safe suggestions. It's built to be a fast, responsive, and easy-to-use tool for anyone needing a moment of support.

**Disclaimer:** This chatbot is intended for general guidance and support. It is **not a substitute for a licensed professional therapist or medical advice**. If you are in crisis, please contact a local mental health hotline or emergency services.

---

## 2. The Problem ü§î

* **Accessibility:** Professional mental health support isn't always available 24/7 or may be financially out of reach for many.
* **Stigma:** Many individuals feel hesitant to discuss their mental health concerns with friends, family, or even professionals due to social stigma.
* **Immediacy:** Sometimes, people just need to talk or vent in the moment without the formality of scheduling an appointment.

---

## 3. The Solution ‚ú®

PeacePal-AI provides a **confidential, non-judgmental, and instantly available** platform where users can:
* Engage in supportive conversations about their well-being.
* Receive general, AI-generated suggestions based on established wellness principles.
* Interact using either text or voice, making it accessible for different communication preferences.

This tool acts as a stepping stone, encouraging users to seek professional help when needed while offering immediate, low-pressure support.

## 4. Technical Approach üõ†Ô∏è

The application's core is built on a few key components:
* **Frontend:** A clean and interactive user interface is created using **Streamlit**, which allows for rapid development of data-centric web apps in Python.
* **Backend Logic:** The chatbot's brain is powered by the **LLaMA-3** large language model, accessed via the **Groq API**. Groq is used for its incredibly low latency, ensuring real-time, natural-feeling conversations.
* **State Management:** Streamlit's `session_state` is used to maintain conversational history. This gives the chatbot "memory," allowing it to understand the context of the ongoing chat.
* **Voice Processing:** For voice input, the app uses the `SpeechRecognition` library to capture and transcribe audio from uploaded `.wav` files into text, which is then processed by the AI model.
* **Safety & Guidance:** A carefully crafted **system prompt** instructs the AI to act as a cautious and helpful advisor, ensuring responses are safe, empathetic, and always include a reminder to consult a professional for serious issues.

## 5. Key Features üöÄ

* üß† **Intelligent Conversations:** Leverages the power of the LLaMA-3 model for nuanced and context-aware responses.
* ‚ö° **Real-Time Interaction:** Ultra-fast response generation thanks to the Groq API.
* üé§ **Dual Input Modes:** Communicate via **text input** or by uploading a **voice message** (`.wav` file).
* üîÑ **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the chat history for a seamless and coherent user experience.
* üîí **Safe & Cautious Tone:** The AI is pre-configured to provide supportive yet responsible advice.
* üåê **Simple Web UI:** Built with Streamlit for a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-navigate interface.

## 6. Project Workflow üåä

1.  **User Interface:** The user opens the Streamlit application in their browser.
2.  **User Input:** The user chooses to either type a message or upload a `.wav` audio file.
3.  **Voice Transcription:** If an audio file is uploaded, `SpeechRecognition` processes it and converts the speech to text.
4.  **Append History:** The user's message (as text) is appended to the conversation history stored in `st.session_state`.
5.  **API Request:** The entire conversation history is sent as a payload to the Groq API endpoint.
6.  **AI Response:** The LLaMA-3 model generates a relevant and contextual response.
7.  **Display Output:** The AI's response is appended to the session state and instantly displayed in the chat UI.
8.  The loop continues, allowing for a continuous conversation.

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    * Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
    * Add your Groq API key to this file:

## 9. How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Once the setup is complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

##10. Future Improvements üí°
  This project has a strong foundation, but there are many ways it could be enhanced:

-Real-time Microphone Input: Implement live speech-to-text directly from the user's microphone instead of file uploads.

-Text-to-Speech (TTS): Add an option for the chatbot to speak its responses aloud.

-User Session History: Implement a simple database (like SQLite) to allow users to save and revisit their past conversations.

-Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the emotional tone of the user's input to provide more empathetic and tailored responses.

-Deployment: Containerize the application with Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform like Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Community Cloud for public access.
